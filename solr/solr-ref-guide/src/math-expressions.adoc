The Streaming Expression library includes a powerful
mathematical programing syntax with many of the features of a
functional programming language. The syntax includes variables,
data structures and a growing set of mathematical functions.

This user guide provides an overview of the different areas of
mathematical coverage starting with basic scalar math and
ending with machine learning. Along the way the guide covers variables
and data structures and techniques for combining Solr's
powerful streams with mathematical functions to make every
record in your Solr Cloud cluster computable.
