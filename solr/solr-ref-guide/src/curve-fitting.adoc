== Polynomial Curve Fitting


The `polyfit` function is used to model the *non-linear* relationship between two random variables.

The `polyfit` function is passed *x* and *y* axises and returns a smooth curve that best fits the y values.
If only a single array is passed it is treated as the *y* axis and a sequence is generated for the *x* axis.
